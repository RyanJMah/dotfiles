# My Dotfiles

Contains my own personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various tools and applications
I use. I've made them public so others may steal some snippets if they would like.

**Note:**

* **Running the install scripts will likely overwrite your existing configurations and break your
  current environment. Please review the scripts and what they do before running them, and use
  them at your own risk.**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RyanJMah/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

# For OSX
./install_macos.sh

# For Debian based Linux distros
./install_linux.sh
```
